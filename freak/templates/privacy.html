## How do we collect your data

The data collected is provided as a part of automated logging, or
explicitly logged when accessing determined resources (in that case, a
warning is usually put when accessing the resource), included but not limited
to the use of tracking pixels.

## How will we use your data

The stated data is collected for various reasons, including law compliance, attack prevention and providing the service.

We take privacy, be it ours or the one of our users, very seriously.

We see leaks of private content (including chats) or data breach, be it in our public spaces or elsewhere, 
as a betrayal of our trust and the trust of our users, other than a crime and a breach of NDA.
We'll close an eye ONLY when we happen to receive a valid subpoena from an accredited authority,
and we are forced to comply at gunpoint or under threat of legal consequences.

## How do we store your data

The data collected is stored securely in EU servers. However, 
[our hosting provider](https://www.keliweb.it/) may have random access to the data we collect.

IPs and user agents logged explicitly are deleted after about 3 years.
